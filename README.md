# Electric Longboard Calculator
## Team Members:
Caleb Clough
Austin Gray
Max Smith


## Vision Statement
Create longboard/electric motor calculator as a means to calculate a more appropriate estimation of range and speed for anyone looking to make/use an electric longboard or really any electric motor under load with or without a set gear ratio.

## Motivation:
Austin makes electric longboards and had issues always having to do the calculations by hand or showing potential customers how a different battery or motor combination could change the way that they utilize their boards.

## Risks to Completion:
        * Unknown language for project
        * Unfamiliar teammates
        * Agile is an unfamiliar developing method to the group
        * Scrum is an unfamiliar work practice to the group

## Mitigation Strategy for the above Risks
        * Learn the language through practice and research
        * Learn more about teammates strengths and weaknesses through weekly interaction like scrum and slack/email communication
        * Learn and research more about the Agile process as we progress through the course and assignments
        * Learn more about the importance of scrum meetings as we progress through the course through practice and assignments
        
 ## Development Method:
        * Scrum
        * Rather than have a daily scrum meeting we plan to use a weekly approach with a meeting once a week or more if an emergency arises.
        * Have the three major groups for ToDo, In Progress and done to denote the stage each story is in
        * Each story will be decided upon/sized and allocated to the individual responsible for it after the weekly scrum meeting.
        
 ## Project tracking Software:
        * Use Github's built in tracking software for projects.
 
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.21.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).

You will need an installation of node.js as well as to install npm in order to see your project. Navigate to localhost:4200 to see the project.

I recommend using Github Desktop as well as visual studio code for the most seemless github integration
