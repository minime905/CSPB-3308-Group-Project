    Welcome to the Electric Longboard Calculator!
    <br><br>
    <p>
    Use this app to quickly determine the max speed, max voltage,
     motor rpm, and range of your electric longboard based on the required
     inputs. The inputs can be acquired through different product specs and
     manufacturers. Providing these inputs will yield immediate calculations.
     You can adjust these inputs until you are satisfied.
      <br><br>
      We hope this speeds up your ability to quickly build and optimize the best
       electric longboard for you.
       <br><br>
       Details for each input, output, and how they are calculated can be found here:
