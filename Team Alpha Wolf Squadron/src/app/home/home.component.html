    HI,
    <br><br>
    Welcome to the Electric Longboard Calculator!
    <br><br>
    Return here to the Home screen should you have
    any questions about the calculations this app provides.
    <br><br>
    Use this app to quickly determine the max speed, max voltage,
     motor rpm and range of your electric longboard based on the required
     inputs. The inputs can be acquired through different product specs and
     manufacturers. Providing these inputs will yield immediate calculations.
     you can adjust these inputs until you are satisfied and if you have signed
      in you may save your results.
      <br><br>
      You may compare the different results you have saved on the
      compare page.
      <br><br>
      We hope this speeds up your ability to quickly build and optimize the best
       electric longboard for you.
       <br><br>
       Details for each input, output and how they are calculated can be found here:
